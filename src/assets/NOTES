PROJECT:
  The main goal of the website will be to promote downtown Foley, and the Main Street initiative, to both business owners and 
  the general public. Attracting small businesses to the downtown area, such as restaurants, bars and boutiques, will be a top 
  priority for the website. Additionally, a directory of existing business and a calendar of events will be employed to drive 
  visitors to downtown. 

  We recommend using a 3rd party calendar software on the website which would display event information in an attractive and informative way. 
  Event information would be added/edited by the Foley Main Street team.

  The website would also feature a directory of available commercial real estate in the area that is available for lease/purchase. 
  Listing information would need to be provided to High Seas, and quarterly updates would be performed to keep the directory current.

QUESTIONS/LIST: 
  // Categories for info? ie: shopping, dining, business...
  // Official city info?
  // Socials?
  // Board?
